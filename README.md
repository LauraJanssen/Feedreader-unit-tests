# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

The unit tests are now finished up so the application's functionality is adequately tested.

### How to Run:
Download or Clone this repository.
To run the application and the unit tests, load the `index.html` file into your browser.
